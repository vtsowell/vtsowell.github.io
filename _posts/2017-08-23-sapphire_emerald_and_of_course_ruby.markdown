so i've been researching gems since i'm stuck on creating my own gem currently, and i've found some pretty useful gems. we've already had to use bundler and nokogiri, which are both great gems. did you know there was a gem called mustache? it is a "framework-agnostic way to render logic-free views," and the creator notes that "it emphasizes separating logic from presentation." there is also passenger, which makes running ruby web applications much easier.
there are lists and lists of gems that you can add to your ruby codes, all which do different things and could possibly make your code shorter and easier to write!
