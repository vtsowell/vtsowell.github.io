i am quirky and weird. i apologize in advance for my blog posts not being conventional. 

it was pretty easy to work with, i assume that was the point in introducing it. i am thankful i got to play around with the software while in school, because now i'll have the resource in my tool box when i'm working on real life code!

i imagine that app building or mobile designs of websites are necessary for every website now that smart phones are a societal norm. i didn't think the curriculum covered how to design mobile sites, let alone introduce us to so many things to look out for and how to effectively create a layout.
