looping was when i realized i understood how to code, not just how to regurgitate. i started learning loops in my intro to programming class freshman year of college (almost 4 years ago). when i came across loops in the flatiron curriculum i tested myself. i tried to write pseudo code before i read on about how to properly write a loop. 

i passed all the labs super quickly because i got the concept around looping, not just what it means to write a simple loop over and over again. this gave me confidence in myself, and made me want to continue on to my next challenge.
