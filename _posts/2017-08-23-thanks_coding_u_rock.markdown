the description of this blog disappeared before i could get an idea of what i wanted to write about, so i'm going to write about what life skills coding has taught me. i believe that part of life is being open to the fact that everyone has their own flaws and insecurities. my flaws range from not trusting in myself to impatience and being easily frustrated. learning to code has pushed me out of my comfort zone so much so that i have recognized these flaws in myself and i've noticed myself inadvertently working on them. i have to be patient because coding takes a while to finally get it all working, especially when you start from nothing. but the more i move through each lesson, the more i tell myself, "ok, maybe i am kind of good at this." sometimes i think i'm completely on the wrong track with my initial thinking, or i just assume that i already don't know how to write or fix a piece of code, and as silly as it sounds, a lot of the time that sets me back in the curriculum. i will stay stagnant for too long, simply because of my own silly mind. 

it's all a work in progress, and recognizing these things are the first steps towards not being like this!! if i had never learned to code, i might never have found that i have some personal growth to do. i am excited to take steps towards a better me thanks to coding, and i don't even care if that is super corny!
