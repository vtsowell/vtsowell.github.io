so i probably won't ever use them. it may be grammatically incorrect, but this is my blog not yours, silly. 

the pressing question today is why programming??? 

i ask myself this question every day that i work on my flatiron school work. honestly, i program because of my father; i was basically born into it. my dad has worked for over thirty years (as you can see, i also hate using real numbers like 12345) in computer and network security for the u.s. government. when i left for college, he made sure i had an introduction to programming class on my class roster. i learned python first and i totally sucked at it. two years later i gave it another try from a math perspective. i got a b+ in the class.... so i thought okay, maybe i'll give this a try. 

programming is the most statisfyingly challenging thing i have ever done in my life. that is why i love it. that is why i push through the error messages and the discouraging bold red fonts. in the end, the green working code is more satisfying than anything i've ever done.
